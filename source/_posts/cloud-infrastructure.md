title: Cloud infrastructure (multicloud + multiclusters)
---

[offscale.io](http://offscale.io) specialises in scalable infrastructure.
## Clouds
We optimise public/private/hybrid cloud infrastructure to increase data-locality, decrease cost and boost server utilisation through a combined multicloud/multicluster approach.

Over 50 different clouds are supported.

## Excerpts
From our keynote at the AWS meetup:
> I'm not telling you to leave Amazon. All I'm saying is abstract all your components to reduce costs and requisite management overhead, call up Amazon, Google, Microsoft, & IBM and see who'll give you the best deal.

From our keynote at CBA's Mesos meetup:
>"Back at Telstra I realised their resource allocation was enormously inefficient. Integration of open-source Mesos technologies alongside centralisation of staff would yield a projected 100M first-year savings, with greater profits enabled through accessible agility facilitation."

Additionally we are the only Australian Mesosphere DC/OS launch-partner and also hold multiple IBM sponsorships.

These partnerships enable our deployments to 10s of thousands of nodes. E.g.: The Mesosphere technologies we push have been deployed across 80 thousand nodes at Twitter, and handle the entire Siri platform at Apple.
